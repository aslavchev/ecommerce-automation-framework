## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document significant architectural decisions, their context, alternatives considered, and consequences. They help:
- Explain "why" behind technical choices
- Onboard new team members
- Avoid revisiting settled decisions
- Learn from past decisions

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Context**: Problem and constraints
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why it was chosen
- **Alternatives**: What else was considered
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and impacts
